# Bayesian Analysis of Macroeconomic Influences on Inflation and Gold Price

This repository contains the code and datasets used in our study on understanding the intricate behavior of inflation and gold price in relation to their influential factors. Using Bayesian analysis and causal inference models, we explore significant correlations and the time-delayed nature of economic indicators' impact.

## Project Overview

Our research aims to analyze several influential factors on inflation including money supply, prime interest rate, GDP growth, and others. We also investigate how inflation and other economic indicators relate to the gold price, confirming its effectiveness as an inflation-hedging asset.

## Key Findings

- Significant positive correlation between oil price change and inflation.
- Time-delayed effects play a crucial role in economic policymaking, with a consistent 12-month lag observed in central bank responses to inflation surges.
- Gold serves as an effective hedge against inflation, showing a strong correlation with CPI inflation but not with the stock index performance or GDP growth.
